## üßë‚Äçüíª About me
- üåç I currently reside in Vespasiano, MG, which is part of the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area.
- üéì **Software Engineering and Full-Stack Development Specialist**
- ‚ö° Experience in **Front-end, Back-end, DevOps, and Databases**
- üéØ Objective: Deliver robust, scalable, and high-impact solutions

 I am an experienced full-stack developer who builds modern web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue.js, and Node.js technologies. I work on both the front and back ends, focusing on scalable, high-performance, high-quality solutions.

I have experience developing complex features, refactoring legacy code, and implementing structural improvements while paying close attention to organization, performance, and maintainability. I work with relational and non-relational databases, such as MySQL and MongoDB, and automated testing tools, such as Jest, Mocha, and Chai. I use Docker, Git, and CI/CD to ensure consistent environments and continuous delivery.

I adhere to best development practices such as test-driven development, clean version control, and robust software architecture. I am also familiar with Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban. I value collaboration, communication, and efficiency in the development process.

I am always looking to improve my technical skills by staying up to date with new technologies and industry standards. I am ready to take on technical challenges with responsibility, autonomy, and a commitment to results.
